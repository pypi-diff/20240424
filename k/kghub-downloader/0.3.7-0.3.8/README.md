 The downloader requires a YAML file which contains a list of target URLs to download, and local names to save those downloads.  
 For an example, see [example/download.yaml](example/download.yaml)
 
 Available options are:

+- \***url**: The URL to download from. Currently supported:
   - `http(s)`
   - `ftp`
     - with `glob:` option to download files with specific extensions (only with ftp as of now and looks recursively).
   - Google Cloud Storage (`gs://`)
   - Google Drive (`gdrive://` or https://drive.google.com/...). The file must be publicly accessible.
   - Amazon AWS S3 bucket (`s3://`)
 - **local_name**: The name to save the file as locally
 - **tag**: A tag to use to filter downloads
 - **api**: The API to use to download the file. Currently supported: `elasticsearch`
